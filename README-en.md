# 📚 Study Guides on ROS2 from Featured Repositories

This repository brings together a series of study guides designed to learn **ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)** by exploring relevant public projects. Each guide breaks down a specific repository through theoretical explanations, visual diagrams, examples, and practical commands.

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Understand the fundamentals of ROS2 through the analysis of real projects.
- Structure knowledge with visual support (Mermaid, Markdown tables, etc.).
- Serve as a study resource for students and self-learners interested in robotics.
- Document the learning process in a clear, progressive, and shareable manner.

## 🧭 What will you find here?

Each folder contains a guide in `README.md` format, which includes:

✅ Introduction to the analyzed repository  
✅ Explanation of key theoretical concepts in ROS2  
✅ Installation and configuration guide  
✅ Project structure with diagrams  
✅ Execution and testing instructions  
✅ Analysis of nodes, topics, services, and actions  
✅ Additional resources and next steps

## 📁 Available Guides

| Guide | Description | Link |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **MOGI-ROS** | Educational framework with Gazebo simulation for practical ROS2 learning | [View Guide](./MOGI-ROS/MOGI-ROS-en.md) |

> 🔧 *New guides will be added as the study of other ROS2 repositories progresses.*

## 💡 About this initiative

This project is part of my personal self-taught learning process. I believe that studying the code of real projects is a powerful way to consolidate knowledge. If you're also learning ROS2, I hope these guides are helpful to you!

## 🤝 Contributions

Contributions are welcome!

If you'd like to contribute a new study guide, please follow these recommendations:

1. 📂 **Create a folder with the name of the repository you're documenting.**  
   Example: `RepositoryName/`

2. 📄 **Include two `README.md` files: one in Spanish and one in English.**  
   - `README.md` → Spanish version  
   - `README-en.md` (or `README_EN.md`) → English version  
   You can use tags like `<p align="center"><a href="./README-en.md">English</a> | Español</p>` to link them together.

3. 🧠 **Include clear, structured, and visual content:**  
   - Tables, explanatory commands, and diagrams (you can use Mermaid).
   - Brief theoretical explanations when necessary.

4. ✅ **Verify that the commands are functional and up to date.**

5. 📬 **Make a Pull Request briefly explaining what your contribution includes.**

> Your contribution can help many other people who are learning ROS. Thank you for sharing!
